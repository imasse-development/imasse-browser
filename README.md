Imasse Browser is a web browser developed in React Native with the search engine www.imasse.com as the default search engine. The code for the Imasse Browser has been adapted from WeixuanZ's Wink Browsers which can be found at https://github.com/WeixuanZ/wink/

## Installation

In order to install the Imasse Browser app you need to clone the repository and use the expo-cli to run locally on your computer. 

```
yarn install
yarn run start
```
## ⇨ How It Works

We display ads like any other search engine, but we use this money differently. We donate these profits to education programs around the world because everyone deserves an education. And It's as simple as just changing your search engine.

## ⇨ Your Privacy

We don't track anything you do ever! We don't collect any personal information about you so your searches are always private.

## ⇨ Research Easier and Faster
Filter results based on credibility and easily create citations for any results just by clicking on the bookmark icon in the bottom right.
